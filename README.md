Abstract - The overall goal of the research work is to localize user needs and discover ways to implement electronics into the inhaler in order to solve 
the needs and improve the user experience and service provisioning. Planning a context-aware middleware may be a challenging issue because of 
particular characteristics of settings and gadgets such as the energetic nature of setting and asset confinement of gadgets. Moreover, the 
middleware ought to give an agreeable framework in which application designers seem effortlessly trade determining relevant data. To address 
these issues, an structural plan of a smart-inhaler for context-aware middleware is proposed in this paper that bolsters participation among 
application engineers. Our whole system is IoT based and our output will give an efficient system for the patients of Asthma. In this work, 
different types of sensors and the connections between the sensors and server are the main base of the system. Different types of sensors have 
been used for the working process and for the base system SOC (system on chip). Most importantly, this system should provide a good connection 
with the smartphone. As asthma patients consider inhaler to be their lifesaver, it needs to be efficient and user friendly. Considering all the
possible options we have tried to deliver a smart product to those asthma patients.
